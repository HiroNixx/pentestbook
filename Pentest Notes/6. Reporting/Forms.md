Forms

We use forms to make our attack logging easier

Start with A:
This form contains the IP addresses in the scope of your engagement.
Here you will collect information such as, geographical location, net block
number and owner.

D:
This form contains all the domains found on a given IP. This table is related
to A through the A column. Not all the domains (usually all or none) will be
in the scope of your engagement. You will make sure to mark with a visible
V the ones that are, and with a X the ones that are not.

DS:
Subdomains and the related information will be stored here. If web
application security is in the scope of engagement you will want to
insert even more details in this table. However a link to W forms is
given. These forms are specifically designed for web application
security testing engagements.
Note that this form is related to D since a domain can have multiple subdomains.

DP:
DP form contains information about people: emails, addresses,
accounts into forums and social networks and so on. This form will
be specifically useful for Social Engineering attacks. Sometimes
emails are related to departments instead of single persons and
sometimes you will be even able to understand the position of the person from the
documents metadata produced or the Headers of email addresses.

P:
This form will be filled after you have used your favorite port scanning tool,
namely nmap. If you’re able to gather the banner or the version of the
service you will have this form almost ready for mapping the attack surface
stage.

E:
This form stores the results of the Enumeration phase.
Netbios Shares, printers, usernames, password policies and so on.
Since this information is very heterogeneous you will need to further classify
it through the column Type. Possible values can be “shares”, “usernames”
etc.
