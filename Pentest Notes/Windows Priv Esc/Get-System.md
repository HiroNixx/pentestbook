1. Technique 1 creates a named pipe from Meterpreter. It also creates and runs a service that runs cmd.exe /c echo “some data” >\\.\pipe\[random pipe here].  
When the spawned cmd.exe connects to Meterpreter’s named pipe,  Meterpreter has the opportunity to impersonate that security context.
 Impersonation of clients is a named pipes feature. The context of the service is SYSTEM, so when you impersonate it, you become SYSTEM.

2. Technique 2 is like technique 1. It creates a named  pipe and impersonates the security context of the first client to  connect to it. 
To create a client with the SYSTEM user context, this  technique drops a DLL to disk(!) and schedules rundll32.exe as a service  to run the DLL as SYSTEM.
 The DLL connects to the named pipe and that’s it. Look at elevate_via_service_namedpipe2 in Meterpreter’s source to see this technique.
As the help information states, this technique drops a file to disk.  This is an opportunity for an anti-virus product to catch you. 
If you’re  worried about anti-virus or leaving forensic evidence, I’d avoid  getsystem –t 0 (which tries every technique) and I’d avoid getsystem –t  2.

3. Technique 3 is a little different. This technique  assumes you have SeDebugPrivileges—something getprivs can help with.
 It  loops through all open services to find one that is running as SYSTEM  and that you have permissions to inject into.
  It uses reflective DLL injection to run its elevator.dll  in the memory space of the service it finds. 
  This technique also passes  the current thread id (from Meterpreter) to elevator.dll. 
  When run,  elevator.dll gets the SYSTEM token, opens the primary thread in  Meterpreter, and tries to apply the SYSTEM token to it.
 

This technique’s implementation limits itself to x86 environments  only. On the bright side, it does not require spawning a new process and 
 it takes place entirely in memory.
